# Extract_Maps.py Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes implemented in `Extract_Maps.py` to address the issues with the Google Maps data extraction script.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Replace undetected_chromedriver with standard Selenium WebDriver
**Problem**: The current implementation using undetected_chromedriver was causing file creation errors.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced `import undetected_chromedriver as uc` with standard Selenium imports
- Changed `uc.ChromeOptions()` to `Options()`
- Changed `uc.Chrome(options=options)` to `webdriver.Chrome(options=options)`
- Added additional Chrome options for better stability:
  - `--disable-gpu`
  - `--disable-extensions`

### 2. ✅ Fix UnboundLocalError for processed_count variable
**Problem**: Variable scope issue where `processed_count` was being referenced before assignment in the threading function.

**Solution**:
- Moved `processed_count = 0` initialization outside the try block
- Placed it at the beginning of the `process_urls_thread` function to ensure it's always defined
- This prevents UnboundLocalError if WebDriver initialization fails

### 3. ✅ Implement incremental CSV writing
**Problem**: Script was writing all data at once, causing data loss if it crashed.

**Solution**:
- The incremental CSV writing was already implemented correctly using `append_result_to_csv()`
- Each extracted record is immediately appended to the output CSV file
- Thread-safe writing using locks to prevent file corruption
- Resume capability - skips already processed URLs

### 4. ✅ Fix parallel processing threading logic
**Problem**: Threading implementation appeared to run sequentially rather than in parallel.

**Solution**:
- Improved URL distribution logic to use configurable number of threads (up to 4)
- Changed from simple even/odd split to proper chunk distribution
- Enhanced thread creation to handle variable number of threads
- All threads start immediately and run concurrently
- Better load balancing across threads

### 5. ✅ Improve error handling
**Problem**: Lack of proper exception handling around WebDriver initialization and URL processing.

**Solution**:
- Added specific `WebDriverException` handling with helpful error messages
- Added detailed error logging with full tracebacks
- Improved WebDriver initialization error messages
- Better guidance for users when ChromeDriver issues occur
- Enhanced safe driver quit functionality

### 6. ✅ Clean up and optimize code
**Problem**: Code contained large commented-out sections and unused imports.

**Solution**:
- Removed all commented-out code blocks (over 300 lines)
- Cleaned up unused imports (`Service`, `ActionChains`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`, `queue`)
- Made input/output filenames more generic and configurable
- Improved code structure and readability

## Key Improvements

### Threading Architecture
- **Before**: 2 threads with even/odd URL distribution
- **After**: Up to 4 threads with balanced chunk distribution
- **Benefit**: Better parallelization and load balancing

### Error Resilience
- **Before**: Basic error handling, potential for thread crashes
- **After**: Comprehensive error handling with specific WebDriver error detection
- **Benefit**: More stable execution and better debugging information

### Data Safety
- **Before**: Risk of data loss if script crashed
- **After**: Real-time incremental writing with resume capability
- **Benefit**: No data loss, can resume interrupted extractions

### Code Quality
- **Before**: 750+ lines with extensive commented code
- **After**: ~420 clean, focused lines
- **Benefit**: Easier to maintain and understand

## Configuration Options

### Input/Output Files
```python
input_filename = 'input_urls.csv'      # Change to your input CSV file
output_filename = 'google_maps_output.csv'  # Output will be saved here
```

### Threading
```python
num_threads = min(4, len(urls))  # Configurable, max 4 threads
```

### Chrome Options
The script now uses standard Chrome options for better compatibility:
- `--window-size=1920,1080`
- `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled`
- `--disable-dev-shm-usage`
- `--no-sandbox`
- `--headless`
- `--disable-gpu`
- `--disable-extensions`

## Testing
A test script `test_fixed_extract_maps.py` has been created to verify all fixes work correctly.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have a CSV file with a 'URL' column containing Google Maps URLs
2. Update the `input_filename` variable in the script if needed
3. Run the script: `python Extract_Maps.py`
4. Output will be saved to `google_maps_output.csv` with real-time incremental writing

## Dependencies
- selenium
- pandas
- Standard Python libraries (csv, os, threading, time, re)

Note: No longer requires `undetected_chromedriver` package.
